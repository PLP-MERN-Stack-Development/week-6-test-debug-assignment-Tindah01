Basic understanding of React and Express.js

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-blog-testing.git
cd mern-blog-testing
Install root dependencies:

bash
npm install
Install client dependencies:

bash
cd client && npm install
Install server dependencies:

bash
cd ../server && npm install
Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:

env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blog-app
MONGO_URI_TEST=mongodb://localhost:27017/blog-app-test
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
PORT=5000
Running the Application
Start both client and server in development mode:

bash
npm start
This will:

Start the React app on port 3000

Start the Express server on port 5000

Access the application at:

text
http://localhost:3000
Testing
